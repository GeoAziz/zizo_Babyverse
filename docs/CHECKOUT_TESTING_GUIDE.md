## Testing the Complete Flow

### 1. PayPal Payment Flow

```bash
# Start your development server
npm run dev

# Navigate to: http://localhost:3000/checkout
```

**Expected Flow:**
1. **Cart Review** → Add items, review cart
2. **Shipping Info** → Fill out shipping details
3. **Payment** → Select PayPal, confirm order
4. **PayPal Redirect** → Complete payment on PayPal
5. **Success Page** → `/checkout/success?paypal=1&orderId=xxx`
6. **Email Sent** → Order confirmation email
7. **Cart Cleared** → Cart is now empty

### 2. Stripe Payment Flow

**Expected Flow:**
1. Follow steps 1-3 above
2. **Payment** → Select Credit Card, confirm order
3. **Stripe Checkout** → Complete payment on Stripe
4. **Success Page** → `/checkout/success?session_id=xxx`
5. **Email Sent** → Order confirmation email
6. **Cart Cleared** → Cart is now empty

### 3. Order Management

**View Orders:**
- Navigate to `/profile?tab=orders`
- See all your orders with status
- Click "View Details" for individual order page

**Order Status Updates:**
```bash
# API endpoint for status updates
PATCH /api/orders/status
{
  "orderId": "order_id_here",
  "status": "Shipped",
  "trackingNumber": "TRACK123456",
  "notes": "Shipped via courier"
}
```

## What Happens Behind the Scenes

### PayPal Flow:
1. `POST /api/orders` creates order + PayPal payment
2. User completes payment on PayPal
3. PayPal redirects to `/checkout/success?paypal=1&orderId=xxx`
4. Success page calls `POST /api/orders/capture-paypal`
5. API captures payment, updates order status
6. Cart is cleared via Firestore
7. Email confirmation sent via `/api/email/order-confirmation`

### Stripe Flow:
1. `POST /api/orders` creates order + Stripe session
2. User completes payment on Stripe
3. Stripe redirects to `/checkout/success?session_id=xxx`
4. Success page calls `GET /api/orders/verify-stripe`
5. API verifies payment, updates order status
6. Cart is cleared via Firestore
7. Email confirmation sent

## Error Handling

### Payment Failures:
- **Network errors** → Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **PayPal/Stripe errors** → Clear error messages shown
- **Order not found** → Graceful error with retry option
- **Authentication issues** → Redirect to login

### Email Failures:
- **SMTP errors** → Logged but don't break order flow
- **Invalid email** → Order still processes successfully
- **Service unavailable** → Automatic retry mechanism

## Email Notifications

- 📧 **Beautiful HTML design** with BabyVerse branding
- 📱 **Mobile responsive** layout
- 📋 **Complete order details** with itemized list
- 📍 **Shipping address** confirmation

- 🔗 **Direct links** to track order and contact support

### Status Update Emails:
